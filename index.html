                    Live Hacks is a regularly arranged hackathon where Coders, Designers and Makers come together in Stockholm,
                    Sweden to revolutionize the way we experience live-entertainment events. Organized by a close group of technology
                    enthusiasts, product designers, music lovers, engineers and entrepreneurs, we passionately believe that big dreams
                    combined with smart technology can change reality to the better. We value having fun through artistic expression
                    and gather people around the same table to jointly co-create. We love well thought out design and the clash of
                    the digital and physical reality. And we are ready to bring the magic of the digital century to live entertainment
                    events.

                    In a more and more digitalized world, everything we do is somehow connected to computers, algorithms and
                    source code. As little as twenty years ago, musicians spent most of their time with guitars, pianos
                    and drum sets and designers illustrated with paper, pens and ink. Software and hardware
                    developers were regarded as a specialized niche group, working in front of flimmering
                    computer screens. However, times have changed: Whether as a creative or an engineer,
                    chances are the computer is an essential part of the creation process. Yet, communication
                    between disciplines is still lacking - we still hang out and create within the same
                    peer groups.

                    created an interactive moment where the accelerometer in phones was

                    the phones created a pattern which was visualized on a big screen.

                    LiveHacks #1 took place 25 meters underground in Sweden's first nuclear hall on the 22nd of April 2017. We filled it with coders, designers, makers, light & sound engineers and music enthusiasts who all worked on challenges connected to how we experience live entertainment connected to technology. The participants were divided into teams of about five, where different expertise were present in terms of coding, designing and hardware. The challenge of the day was to work upon a project connected to how we experience mobile technology in live events, and each team worked upon a project which were either of own choice fitting into the theme or picked a proposed project where Stagecast provided API’s which the teams could build upon.

                    The next Live Hacks will happen on Saturday the 9th of September 2017 at Studioteatern which belongs
                    to the university College of Opera (Teknikringen 35, Stockholm), which is an old high voltage
                    test laboratory of KTH. Today it is mainly used for theater, operas and concerts, and we
                    love the atmosphere which is created by the giant brick wall, big red velvet curtains
                    and the bleachers. The hack will start at 9am and finish at midnight. We will again
                    explore how mobile technology can be integrated into live events and will offer
                    some interesting challenges to work upon. Participants will be divided into
                    teams of five members, where each team will consist of at least three developers and
                    one graphic designer. Teams can choose to work on own ideas regarding how technology
                    can be utilized in a live setting, or on provided hack challenges. This time participants
                    have the chance to apply to proposed projects already in the application process. During
                    the entire day teams will collect stars for their progress through accomplishing different
                    quests - the team with the most stars at the end of the night will win the grand prize!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will provide you with food, drinks, beer, interesting guest speaker and good music
                    throughout the day. So, what are you waiting for? Apply either as a coder, designer

                        The application closes 10 days before the event, and 7 days before the D-day we will let the applicants know whether they were accepted or not. After that, we will invite the participants to Slack, where we will put the different participants in their teams where conversations can start, github repositories can be initiated and simply be a channel for enabling communication even days before the hack take place.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For the D-day, LiveHacks is ongoing for one whole day, where we start at 9am and finish at midnight. We will kick off by letting everyone be on the same page why we do this, what is the scope of the event, and then the teams can kick off whether project they will work upon during the day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After lunch, our main partner will talk for about 5 minutes about what they are up to, followed by a guest speaker who will talk 20 minutes about projects which are connected to technology and music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides the project every team will be working upon, there will be different quests sent out during the day which is a way for the team to collect points. Such quests are small projects which do not have to take more then 20-30 minutes in time to accomplish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Towards the end of the night, all teams who want to present and therefore have a chance to compete for the prizes will send presentations to the organizing team, and at 11pm the presentations will kick off where each team has five minutes in the spotlight to show everyone what they have been working upon.

                    Stagecast is a live interaction platform for entertainment events, and together with our community we just simply love to gather people to work upon challenging projects which are closely connected to what we want to achieve - integrating technology into live events to enhance our here and now. As living in the 21st century we are not alone in being curious to investigate how we can utilize technology in the best way, and that is why we are lucky to have great companies with us for the different events.

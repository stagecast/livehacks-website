                    Live Hacks is a regularly arranged hackathon event where Coders, Designers and Makers come together in Stockholm,
                    Sweden to revolutionize the way we experience live entertainment events. Organized by a close group of technology
                    enthusiasts, product designers, music lovers, engineers and entrepreneurs, we passionately believe that big dreams
                    combined with smart technology can change reality to the better. We value having fun through artistic expression
                    and gather people around the same table to jointly co-create. We love well thought-out design and the clash of
                    the digital and physical reality. And we are ready to bring the magic of the digital century to live entertainment
                    events.

                    In a more and more digitalized world, everything we do is somehow connected to computers, algorithms and
                    source code. As little as twenty years ago, musicians spent most of their time with guitars, pianos
                    and drum sets and designers illustrated with paper, pens and ink. Software and hardware
                    developers were regarded as a specialized niche group, working in front of flimmering
                    computer screens. However, times have changed: Whether as a creative or an engineer,
                    chances are the computer is an essential part of the creation process. Yet, communication
                    between disciplines is still lacking - LiveHacks invites to come together and jointly co-create.

                    the phones created a pattern which was visualized on a big screen behind the performer. Magic.

                    The last LiveHacks event took place on the 22nd of April 2017 - 25 meters underground in Sweden's first nuclear hall. We filled the Reaktorhall with coders, designers, makers, light & sound engineers and music enthusiasts who all worked on different challenges. Each team either worked on their own project or chose from a project portfolio. Stagecast provided APIs and frameworks.

                    The next LiveHacks will happen on the 3rd of February 2018 at the beautiful Reaktorhallen on Drottning Kristinas väg 51, 
                    Stockholm (fun fact: Reaktorhallen was the first nuclear reactor hall of Sweden). 
                    Today the venue is used for cultural events, organ concerts and for a few classes at KTH. 
                    The hack will start and finish at midnight, and this time a band called Phogg will have a concert at 1am for those who have the energy to stay and enjoy that and the after party with us. 
                    Also, teams who would like to try out their projects developed during the day are more than welcome! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Participants will be divided into teams of five members, where each team will consist of at least three coders and one graphic designer. 
                    Teams can choose to work on own ideas regarding how technology can be utilized in a live setting, or on provided hack challenges. 
                    This time our dear partners Telia offer an extra interesting project: 
                    “How to make a corporate presentation into a rock n’roll show?”, ready more about it in the application! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the entire day teams will collect stars for their progress through accomplishing different quests - 
                    the team with the most stars at the end of the night will win the grand prize (and hopefully also try out their project during the live performance after the event!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will provide you with food, drinks, beer, interesting guest speaker and live music throughout the day. 
                    So, what are you waiting for? Apply either as a coder, designer or maker now (last application date is the 31st of January)!

                        The application closes ten days before the event. Seven days before the D-day we will let the applicants know whether they were accepted. All participants will be invited to Slack, where we put the different participants in their teams so that conversations can start and github repositories initiated.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        LiveHacks is ongoing for one full day. We start at 9am and finish at midnight. We will kick off with a short introduction - then the fun begins and teams start working on their projects! NOTE: This time, a concert with the band Phogg will take place after the presentations at 1am, we hope everyone want to stay and enjoy the party with us!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After lunch, it is time for our guest speaker! The guest speaker is usually a pioneer from the Stockholm tech or music industry and shares his or her views, inspires or teaches about a topic of interest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides the project, there will be different quests sent out during the day through the Stagecast app. With these quests, participants can collect points and stars for their teams. Quests are small projects that usually do not have to take more than 20-30 minutes to accomplish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Towards the end of the night, all teams present their projects on the main stage. Each team has three minutes in the spotlight to show everyone what they have been working upon. Open Bar, dimmed light,  live music and mingling afterwards is a promise!

                <p class="answer">
                    Stagecast is a young, growing Stockholm based startup within the live entertainment industry. We build a live interaction platform for entertainment events and we love to gather creative people to work upon integrating technology into live entertainment events in order to enhance our here and now.

                <p class="question">
                    6. Why do I have to agree to your NDA & IP agreement? 
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
                    The reason why we have the terms and condition which we brought forward together with a lawyer is due to the fact that we open up quite a lot of our API's from Stagecast platform which can be out of great help for teams to access and use when kickstarting their projects of the day. It is simply a way of protecting the IP from someone stealing everything even though the odds are low. 
                    Without such agreement we would not be allowed to host the hackathon as we are planning to. We are bound to our partners, investors and sponsors with ND&NC agreements ourselves. These parties make this hackathon happen - without we would have to make the participants pay. However, we want to share our information with the participants as we believe in an open exchange of thoughts, ideas and interactions where everyone has the opportunity to participate. Yet, we need to make clear that participants are not obtaining the rights to use these APIs and frameworks to build a competing business. For your information - we do not want to keep such harsh agreements in the future. As a matter of fact, our APIs are planned to be opened for third-party-developers once the product is launched and we are ready to do so.

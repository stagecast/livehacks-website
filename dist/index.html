        <h1>What is Livehacks?</h1>
        <p>
          In a more and more digitalized world, everything we do is somehow connected to computers, algorithms and source code.
            As little as twenty years ago, musicians spent most of their time with guitars, pianos and drum sets and designers
            illustrated with paper, pens and ink. Software and hardware developers were regarded as a specialized niche group,
            working in front of flimmering computer screens. However, times have changed: Whether as a creative or an engineer,
            chances are the computer is an essential part of the creation process. What sets us apart is no longer a matter of
            mentality but a matter of only a few mouse clicks. Yet, although we now all share the same pixel playground, communication
            between disciplines is still lacking - we still hang out and create within the same peer groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          Live Hacks is a regularly arranged Hackathon event for Developers, Hackers, Designers and Artists who come together in Stockholm,
            Sweden to revolutionize the way we experience live entertainment events. Organised by a close group of technology enthusiasts, product
            designers, music lovers, engineers and entrepreneurs, we passionately believe that big dreams combined with smart technology can change
            reality to the better. We value having fun through artistic expression and gather people around the same table to jointly co-create.
            We love music, well thought out design and the clash of the digital and physical reality. And we are ready to bring the magic of the
            digital century to live entertainment events.

        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <p>The next Live Hacks event will be held on April 22nd, 2017 at Reaktorhallen underneath the Royal institute of technology.
            The first nuclear reactor of Sweden was developed inside Reaktorhallen. Although the reactor has been disassembled, the
            hall still exists today and makes a stunning Live Hacks location (Fun Fact Alan Walker shot their latest music video here
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDmzGLrdjxQ). The event will start at 9 am in the morning and run past midnight. Don’t miss
            out on the party and live DJ after the hackathon! Participants will be divided into teams of five members. Each team will
            consist of at least three developers and one graphic designer. Teams can choose to work on own Stagecast Moment ideas or
            on provided challenges. During the entire day teams will collect stars for their progress  - the team with the most stars
            at the end of the night will win original Marshall Mid Headphones and a chance for the grand individual Marshall prize! We
            will provide food, drinks and beer throughout the day. So, what are you waiting for? Apply now!

            Hackers are jokers - passionate tinkerers who love to take stuff apart. You are either an experienced sound or electrical engineer and you love to
            play around with event tech. We provide you with relevant hardware and you will have a special mentor during the night.
